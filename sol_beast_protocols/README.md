# Protocol Adapters

This folder contains protocol adapters and IDLs for different memecoin launch platforms.

- `sol_beast_protocols/pumpfun/` - contains IDLs and helper data specific to the pump.fun platform.

This structure allows adding new platform adapters (e.g., other memecoin launching platforms) under `sol_beast_protocols/` while keeping the core codebase agnostic.
